# HT Hash Table

This is a very simple, pure C implementation of a stack-allocated, fixed-size, open-addressed hash table supporting non-floating point values.

Currently, this implementation only runs on arm64 since I wrote it on an Apple Silicon machine, but the only platform-specific bit is the hashing and that could be swapped out easily.
